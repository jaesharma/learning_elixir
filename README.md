## <b> Welcome to my collection of Elixir projects!</b>

I created these projects while learning the Elixir programming language. Each project represents a different concept or feature of the language, and serves as a way for me to practice and solidify my understanding of the language.

I hope that these projects can serve as helpful resources for anyone else who is also learning Elixir. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
